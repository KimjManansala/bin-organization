  * JavaScript
  * Nodejs

##Challenges and Solutions
---
This simple bin-organizer is a way to keep my personal belongings organized.

  * Challenge #1: Rendering
  I found a big challenge was to make sure at any page The user was logged in and so that they can only find their bins and items. I found useful to use express session to make sure each endpoint has a user logged in.

  More challenges to come as I continue to program
